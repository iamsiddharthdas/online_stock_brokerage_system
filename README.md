An Online Stock Brokerage System facilitates its users the trade (i.e. buying and selling) of stocks online. 
It allows clients to keep track of and execute their transactions, and shows performance charts of the different stocks in their portfolios. 
It also provides security for their transactions and alerts them to pre-defined levels of changes in stocks, without the use of any middlemen.
The online stock brokerage system automates traditional stock trading using computers and the internet, making the transaction faster and cheaper. 
This system also gives speedier access to stock reports, current market trends, and real-time stock prices.
